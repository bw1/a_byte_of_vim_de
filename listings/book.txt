    Book I
    
        The Shadow of the Past
    
            Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
            Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
            Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
            One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
            In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
            One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
            One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
            In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
    
        Three is Company
    
            The Road goes ever on and on
            Down from the door where it began.
            Now far ahead the Road has gone,
            And I must follow, if I can,
            Pursuing it with weary feet,
            Until it joins some larger way,
            Where many paths and errands meet.
            And whither then? I cannot say.
